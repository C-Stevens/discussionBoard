# Discussion Board
This project is a generic discussion board website written in PHP for a university course. Despite being fairly simple in design, it was made with clarity and sanity in mind so nevertheless serves as a nice repository of example code for myself and others.

Some features:
* Login/Logout
* Access control for admins and non-admins
* User registration
* Discussion/Post rating
* Ability to post new discussions/posts
* Admin tools
  * List all registered users
  * List all posted discussions
  * Ability to delete any post
  * Ability to remove any user
  * Ability to change access (admin status) of any user

There is no longer a live version of this site, but porting it back to production would require minimal effort due to good seperation of functions.
